            <li>1 tsp fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black ground pepper</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 oz ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol><b>Step 1</b><br>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</ol>
        <ol><b>Step 2</b><br>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</ol>
        <ol><b>Step 3</b><br>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
        <ol><b>Step 4</b><br>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</ol>
        <ol><b>Step 5</b><br>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</ol>
